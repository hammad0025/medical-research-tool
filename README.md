## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Production - RECOMMENDED)
**Full-stack deployment with backend in 5 minutes:**

1. Get Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
2. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub
3. Import repository: `hammad0025/medical-research-tool`
4. Add environment variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your key
5. Deploy!

**Live at:** `https://medical-research-tool.vercel.app`

**Cost:** $0/month hosting + ~$0.15/month API calls

See [VERCEL-DEPLOY.md](VERCEL-DEPLOY.md) for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Use as Claude Artifact (Demo/Testing)
**No deployment needed:**

1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Upload `index.html`
3. Ask: "Please render this as an artifact"
4. The app loads in the right panel

**Perfect for:** Quick demos, testing features

## 📖 Documentation

- **[Executive Summary](docs/Executive-Summary.md)** - Start here for quick overview
- **[Full Documentation](docs/IPF-Research-Assistant-Documentation.md)** - Complete technical guide
- **[Demo Guide](docs/Phase-1-Demo-Guide.md)** - Presentation walkthrough
- **[Example Output](examples/IPF-Treatment-Comparison-Template.xlsx)** - Sample comparison chart

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Attorneys (Dorothy & Tim)
- Research treatment options for IPF clients
- Find clinical trials for specific patient profiles
- Generate evidence-based treatment comparisons
- Identify world-class treatment centers
- Check for medication contraindications

### For Medical Professionals
- Quick literature reviews on IPF treatments
- Clinical trial identification and evaluation
- Patient-specific treatment recommendations
- Cost and insurance coverage research
- Stem cell treatment evaluation

### Sample Research Questions
```
"What are the current FDA-approved treatments for IPF and their efficacy rates?"

"Are there any open clinical trials for IPF that don't use placebos?"

"Which IPF treatment centers are considered world-class and why?"

"Given my age (65) and current medications (prednisone, azathioprine), 
what IPF treatments should I consider and which should I avoid?"

"What stem cell treatments are available for IPF from reputable sources?"
```

## 🔬 How It Works

### AI Research Methodology

1. **Patient Context Integration**
   - System considers all entered patient data
   - Checks for drug interactions and contraindications
   - Personalizes recommendations based on age and comorbidities

2. **Evidence-Based Analysis**
   - Searches Claude's knowledge base (trained through January 2025)
   - Prioritizes peer-reviewed studies and meta-analyses
   - Weights evidence by geographic source and journal impact

3. **Citation Verification**
   - AI must quote specific passages from sources
   - Explains relevance of each citation
   - Notes study limitations and conflicts of interest

4. **Quality Scoring**
   - Efficacy: Based on clinical trial outcomes
   - Safety: Inverse relationship with adverse events
   - Evidence Quality: Weighted by study design, geography, journal IF

### Evidence Weighting System
- **US/Western Europe:** 100% weight
- **Other developed nations:** 75% weight
- **China:** 25% weight (per client requirement)
- **Adjusted by:** Journal impact factor, study design, sample size

## ⚙️ Technical Stack
